## What is the Internet ?

The internet is a very big network of computer, phones, server and many devices around the world so they can share information.

**Example:** It’s like a big library or market where you can read, watch videos, talk to people, or buy things from anywhere.

We all are connected through the internet like this diagram

When we type hello to message some one it goes to over router or any other network you use then it’s travels through router to router or servers to find the person you sent the message or data then it reaches him on his device.

## How it works ?

The internet works connecting your devices through cables, modems and satellites signals to share information. when you request (search anything on browser or opening links), your request goes to the server then server sends you the data.

**Example:**  
Think of it like ordering pizza:

1. **You call the pizza shop (type a website or send a message).**
    
2. **The shop gets your order (your request reaches the server).**
    
3. **They make the pizza (the server processes your request).**
    
4. **The delivery person brings it to your home (internet sends the information back to your device).**
    

## How browser goes to the right person (or website like google.com ) ?

**When we type google.com** on browser it does not know where the google.com is so the browser goes to local **DNS(Domain Name System)** provider and then DNS gives the browser the right address of the google.com it’s called **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** then browser goes to the right address

**Let’s have a simple example :** Think of it like a your name and address, can anyone reach your home with your name **(google.com)?** no right. but if you give them your full address **(IP Address)** like house number, city, country anyone can reach you just like that with the **IP Address** (Example :- 192.23.23.43) you can reach any website but remembering them is hard so we use **Domain name** (google.com).

## DNS (Domain Name System)

1. **Your computer asks the local DNS server:**
    
    * Your device (requesting host) sends a query to the local DNS server to find the address of a website (like `chaicode.com`).
        
2. **Local DNS server checks with the root DNS server:**
    
    * If the local server doesn’t know the address, it asks the root DNS server for help.
        
3. **Root DNS server directs to the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server:**
    
    * The root server tells the local server which TLD server (e.g., .com) to contact next.
        
4. **Local DNS server contacts the TLD server:**
    
    * The local server then asks the TLD server where to find the website’s specific DNS server.
        
5. **TLD server responds with the authoritative DNS server address:**
    
    * The TLD server tells the local server to contact the authoritative DNS server for [`chaicode.com`](https://chaicode.com).
        
6. **Local DNS server contacts the authoritative DNS server:**
    
    * The local server asks the authoritative DNS server for the exact IP address of [google.com](https://google.com/).
        
7. **Authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address:**
    
    * The authoritative server gives the IP address (e.g., `123.45.67.89`) for `chaicode.com` .
        
8. **Local DNS server sends the IP address back to your computer:**
    
    * Your device uses this IP address to connect to the website, and now you can access `chaicode.com` .
        

### **Simple Example:**

It’s like asking for directions:

1. You ask a local guide (local DNS server).
    
2. They ask the main office (root server) for help.
    
3. The main office directs them to a specific area (TLD server).
    
4. Finally, the exact building (authoritative DNS server) gives the final answer (IP address).
